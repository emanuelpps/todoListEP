## Project Details

I created a web application for managing tasks, where you can add, mark as done, or delete tasks from your list. The app also displays the number of pending tasks, and you have the option to change the background image of the application.

### Highlights
- Easily add, mark tasks as done, or delete them for a well-organized to-do list.
- Personalize your experience by customizing the background to match your preferences.
- View completed tasks separately, offering the flexibility to revert them to pending or delete them permanently.
- Stay informed during task management with real-time displays of the current time and date.
- The app integrates a calendar for a comprehensive overview of upcoming tasks, helping you plan activities for the next days.
